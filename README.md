# Facebook Prophet

Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team.
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. 
Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. 

Prophet implements an additive regression model with four elements:

* A piecewise linear, Prophet automatically picks up change points in the data and identifies any change in trends.  
* A yearly seasonal component modeled using Fourier series.
* A weekly seasonal component.
* A holiday list that can be manually provided.
